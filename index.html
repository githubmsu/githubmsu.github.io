								<b>What is Computer Science?:</b><br>
								Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures. [5] 
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>What is Software Development:</b><br>
								Software development is a broad term that envelops all professional works that involve the process of design, development, deployment, and maintenance of software applications. The term “software development,” encompasses both the theory and the actual writing, testing, debugging, crowdsourcing, etc. associated with the development of software [3]. Sub-disciplines of software development are practically part of all our everyday lives in some way or another. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>What is Game Development?:</b><br>
								Video game development is the study of and creation of video games in any form. Video game development can be the making of the music of the game, the sound effects of the game, the visual art of the game, the coding of the game, the game design of the game, the playtesting of the game, etc. Most games are made in a group of specialists of each category mentioned, but there have been games made by just one person doing all the work necessary to make a game.

								<b>Reading in General Computer Science:</b><br>
								Reading in computer science comes in many forms. There is reading in the job, such as viewing client specifications or project deadlines from managers. They also must read and understand code as well as keep up to date with the coding languages they use. Lastly, computer scientists must keep up with new findings in the field, such as optimizations in programs or methods to complete projects. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Reading in Software Development:</b><br>
								Reading takes many different forms in software development which is why it is necessary to be literate in a spoken language as well as “computer language”. Software developers read a lot of internet forum posts, documentations, and relevant articles when they are working on a project. Additionally, being able to read and properly comprehend documentation from other software developers is crucial in ensuring necessary knowledge is obtained to work on projects or software. This keeps them sharp on skills that they may not use very often as well as occasionally providing them with assistance with any problems they may run into.  
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Reading in Video Game Development:</b><br>
								Reading in video game development is less common than in most other fields. The primary role of reading in video game development is reading documentation for the game you are working on and messages from video game development communities on social media sites.  There are textbooks and articles to read for the field, but they do not play as large a role as in other fields. Still, these fewer common sources of information are almost always valuable.

								<b>Writing in Computer Science:</b><br>
								Computer scientists will write in a variety of ways in their field, including emails to coworkers, managers, or clients, writing on public forums like StackOverflow, and writing code. They are required to be able to articulate their work into words so they can be understood by others in and outside of the field when for when they are ready to be used by others. “Instead [of being academically focused], their writing tends to be much more professionally practical. Among other short documents, they will write project proposals, formal requirements specifications, software and code documentation, reports on error detection and resolution, and, of course, code.” [10] Though they may appear unrelated, writing and coding have a similar design approach. They both need to break down complex ideas into more manageable language, highlighting the significance of logical and straightforward communication. The seven writing processes are as follows: collect information, choose pertinent facts, organize information, put ideas into words, style the text for readability, format the material suitably, and end with a comment on the composition. These stages, which reflect the creative and architectural components found in coding, highlight the necessity of organizing, refining, and conceptualizing ideas. On the other hand, program objectives are the first step in programming, followed by designing the program, writing the actual code, compiling it, running the program, testing and debugging it, and finally maintaining and modifying the program, according to C++ author Stephen Prata's seven steps. These actions, typical in coding, are similar to creating an organized and valuable narrative in writing. The parallels between these procedures highlight the shared design concepts that underlie writing and coding [15]. To accomplish the intended results, these processes must carefully weigh the goals and structure, translate abstract concepts into tangible manifestations, and refine them again. In coding and writing, design and creative problem-solving are fundamental, and this juxtaposition emphasizes that these are forms of aesthetic expression and utilitarian procedures.

								<b>Writing in Software Development:</b><br>
								Writing serves as a bridge between software development and other disciplines, and it is a big form of communication within software development. Formal types of writing include academic journal articles and trade publications as well as any writing a company may be commissioned to write. Informal types of communication can include participation in public forums as well as emails and DMs between coworkers or any GitHub repositories they may feel like contributing to. However, the majority of the writing involved in a software development position will be heavily focused on documentation of work, regardless of the need to collaborate. Documentation of code and progress is essential in ensuring anyone else is able to comprehend the purpose and functionality of the software. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Writing in Video Game Development:</b><br>
								The writing a video game developer is to do is not much different from the reading they do.  Writing documentation is imperative for any game project due to the security it provides, and the time it saves explaining how the game works to new developers that have joined or some that need to freshen up for any reason.  Writing social media posts on sites where video game developers go to frequently is also common, as issues you may come across are already likely solved by someone in that community.

								<b>Research in Video Game Development:</b><br>
								Research is constant in video game development. Depending on the task at hand, you will either be interviewing more experience video game developers to get their insight, surveying your player base in various means, traveling to different parts of the world to study the architecture and/or the living things there, going to social media site, etc.  The job of a video game developer is one where new problem always come up and must be faced.  Being able to research and find their solution in a timely manner is critical.

								<b>Quality of Life for Software Developers:</b><br>
								Most Software developers have the opportunity to live almost anywhere in the world they want with flexible work hours and options [1]. Software developers work around 8-9 hours a day or approximately 40-45 hours a week, but hours can go up depending on deadlines [2]. However, it is still generally recommended that software developers work in-person for a set number of days, depending on the place of employment.  
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Quality of Life for Video Game Developers:</b><br>
								Quality of life issues in the field of video game development are rather notorious and have only somewhat gotten better over the years. Work crunching (working longer hours than the usual nine to five expected), job instability, it being very hard to those without experience in the field to find a job (thus making it harder to get the experience needed to get the job to begin with), pay inequality among the different types of developers, the proportion of men to women being staggering [9], the proportion of Caucasian people in the field compared to other races being even more staggering [9], etc.

								<b>Computer Science:</b><br>
								Computer scientists will often use systems like pair programming where two people collaborate on writing or working with code in real time (talking to each other, oral literacy). They also work in and bond with groups of coworkers in their workplaces. [6]. Presenting is another form of literacy, where computer scientists may have to present to others their ideas and work or take part in others’ presentations to advance the whole team forward. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Software Development:</b><br>
								Developers only spend up to around sixty one percent of their working time coding [4]. In larger companies with multiple departments, there are frequent meetings during the week where each team shares any progress, errors, solutions, and discuss together any necessary details regarding their current projects. In fact, companies with multiple departments tend to have frequent meetings to ensure all departments are aware of any changes or issues in other departments that may influence the schedule of related departments. In these cases, documentation is crucial and is frequently used to present the relevant information to other departments during such meetings.
